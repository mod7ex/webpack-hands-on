## try `source-map-loader`

## try `file url`

## [NEEDED] type checking + Error-overlay

## add this to the `.vscode/settings.json` config folder (to have jsx autocompletion in js file)

```json

"files.associations": {
    "*.js": "javascriptreact"
}

```

## [Fix]: https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin didn't work

## [Fix] [webpack-dev-server] "hot: true" automatically applies HMR plugin, you don't have to add it manually to your webpack configuration.
